I started my capstone project, AI coder, by using ChatGPT-4 to create a basic landing page. I wanted to include a login page as well, but when I prompted the model to do so, it ended up deleting most of the original landing page content. I tried multiple times to get both a login section and the original landing page content, but it just wasn't happening. Finally, I manually copied and pasted the original landing page code and successfully added login links at the top and bottom.

During this time, I also used ChatGPT-4 to refresh my knowledge on HTML and CSS. I asked questions about how to save index files, where to save the folders, and how to structure them. This helped me get back up to speed quickly with web development basics.

I decided to explore image importing and signed up for a Midjourney account. I had a bit of a learning curve with it. I asked ChatGPT-4 for specs for a "hero" image and then copied this information into Midjourney. The platform initially misunderstood me and generated images of computer monitor screens instead of a couple with a pet. After re-prompting, I got a four-pack of photos, which I'll need to review further.

I realized that I'll need to spend more time playing around and researching. I want to look into what modern landing pages look like so that I can prompt ChatGPT-4 more effectively. I'm also considering whether the landing page should link to a separate login page or have a hidden login section that appears when clicked.

Overall, I feel like the time could have been better spent, especially on developing the landing page, but I've identified the areas I need to focus on for improvement.
